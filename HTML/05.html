<h1>V. The Myth of Given</h1>
</div>

<div class="text">
<p>	
    In my philosophy studies, one of the intriguing but no-ending debates I have encountered is about the “The Myth of Given”, 
    which illuminates the difficulty of articulating the relationship between the nature of mind and of perception. 
    Simply put, it asks, “Do I really see what I see?”, where the former "see" implies both the consequence of seeing as action and the insight of seeing as knowledge-induced understanding. <br><br>

	But is our “given” limited to the domain of our perception? <br><br>

	I held this question to myself and gradually came to <a class="passage" href="07.html">see</a> that “The Myth of Given” is more ethical than epistemological. 
    It sheds light, and at the same time casts doubt, on everything we are <a class="passage" href="04.html">born</a> with, such as race, gender and social class, that constitutes our “first identity”. <br><br>

	Then the question turns to something that demands our positive response, which is, “Should I see myself as I am seen?”

        The White Guards, a nod to the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), 
        have been a ubiquitous feature of China’s Zero-Covid Policy. Composed of police officers, 
        medical personnel and members of neighborhood committees, they serve as a major part of the state apparatus to ensure the people’s obedience to the government. 
        Disguising their true identities with suits, they have earned themselves a reputation for physical violence and abuse of power.
