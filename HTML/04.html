<h1>IV. “Born”</h1>
</div>

<div class="text">
<p>	
    When I started learning <a class="passage" href="06.html">English</a>, one phrase that confused and scared me was “I was born ……” 
    Why is it a passive way to speak of the most joyful moment of my coming into the world? Was my birth against my wishes or willingness? <br><br>

	For a long time, I rejected this apparent linguistic misconstruction while keeping writing “I born on…” 
    However, without specific dates recorded, I gradually woke up to its meaning, and I felt that very intellectual progress marked the very loss of my childhood. <br><br>

	Yes, I was born into this world without either my approval or prior knowledge, 
    and all I was <a class="passage" href="05.html">given</a> was beyond my control. My mother, whose bearing gave me birth, never seemed to terminate her pregnancy at the time of her delivery, 
    but simply passed it on to me. So my life was soaked with bearings, and some of them unbearable.

        Wanjun, a four-year-old girl who loved to sing, dance and model, died in March 2022 because she had acute laryngitis, 
        or rather her family failed to present her negative Covid test report when she had acute laryngitis. 
        The hospital rejected them. Their hospital, or most hospitals in China these days, can only treat you if you prove you are not sick with Covid.
