    I haven’t written anything on the Wailing Wall because I feel my life was not affected much by this pandemic. <br>
	Here I selected some comments written by others there from October 30 to November 12, 2022, days 960 to 973 after Dr. Li’s death.

    The filming of  Qing Yu Nian (a popular Chinese TV show) has begun, Dr.Li. I just started my freshman year of college when I met you, 
    and now I'm leaving in my senior year in a couple of days. I remember, when I saw Qing Yu Nian, I thought of you.

    Forget it, Dr. Li. I no longer have the courage to speak up on this platform. Although I have no future, 
    I am afraid that typing a few words will affect the future of  this “nothingness”. Wish the girl who is crying out for help one last time. 
    Wish the soul that has fallen on the earth to sleep in peace. The wind will take her to a free and carefree meadow.

    Dr. Li, I saw you on the memorial wall in London.

    Dr. Li, you are the first, but never the last, and I don't mean the positive test result,
     but the goodness in your heart. Look, so many Chinese who understand suffering, your voice becomes their signpost, 
     your tombstone becomes a statue of a giant, Dr. Li, the world will be better, starting with you.

    Dr. Li, I just fell asleep, but was awakened by a girl downstairs, she waited outside our boys' dormitory with flowers in hand, 
    waiting to go to confess her love, and for a moment, I actually wanted to fall in love again.

    I still remember that night in February two years ago (a reference to the day of Li’s death), 
    many friends kept watch until the news came, and we all struggled to sleep in pain and tears. 
    I still remember the next morning, cold outside the windowsill fell a pigeon, I spoke with friends, 
    and we comforted each other that it was you who was comforting everyone. I hope all is well with you, really really really hope you can update a tweet again.

    Dr. Li, the house seal has controlled us for more than 30 days, 
    the food can not afford to buy, and the pocketbook is also almost gone. 
    People in the hometown commit suicide every day, and the one who jumped her daughter's howl repeatedly echos in my mind, so hard ah
</p><br>

    Dr. Li, I am very happy today, our company has a project in Vietnam, and I am honored to be selected, 
    although I can’t go to a western country, but it's okay to go to Vietnam, to see the world.

    A dust of the times, and a mountain for me. I want to work, work steadily and rest regularly. 
    Anyway, I am a person who has no interest, only hope that health and peace is good.
     However, I am very depressed and passive for the delay in the notice of the examination, a job has become a luxury. 
     How can a person with hands and feet not even find a job, because I have no courage, is a cowardly personality.

    Dr. Li, I was walking along the Thames in London today and saw your name on the Covid-19 Memorial Wall.

    Dr. Li, after the covid test my mom and I went to the mall and fell in love with a sweater, but knowing the price my mom's eyes went gray. 
    I knew there was no way our family could afford it with our financial level. Mom and brother's clothes were a few yuan each, 
    and we bought them at Pinduoduo (an online shopping mall for cheap goods). They worked too hard and were too tired, and why is that?
     Mom's shoes are rarely bought for more than ten yuan, and they end up being worn for several winters, so how come our family is so poor?
</p><br>

    Dr. Li, I was also diagnosed, it was bf.52 branch, now it has evolved to bf.7, 
    I was called to be told the abnormal result and when I was calm on the surface my heart was in panic…
    After 15 days, I turned negative, and had home isolation for 6 days, tomorrow again I will have nasal and pharyngeal Covid tests. 
    Recently I have been afraid of returning to the positive like my friends, eating Chinese medical pills every day, and I don't know when this kind of day will be the end.

    I walked around and photographed this picture in front of my house.
