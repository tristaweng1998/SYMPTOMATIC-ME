<h1>VI. Language and Time</h1>
</div>

<div class="text">
<p>	
    When I started learning English, another thing that puzzled and even annoyed me was the use of tenses, 
    where I had to figure out when I did something before I could talk about what I had actually done or would do.<br><br>

	In Chinese, there is no tense because it doesn’t have an alphabet and it’s not of an analytic pattern, 
    so you can’t change the spelling of words in different tenses. Basically, we feel tense by the way we speak, 
    like we know it is of a past time if you are talking about something you remember or forget. <br><br>

	Nevertheless, in many cases, the tense in speech is pretty ambiguous, as if everything is happening here and now. 
    For example, which tense should I use when I'm talking about the Zero-Covid policy, with all its unnecessary tragedies and all our disappointment, outrage and despair? <br><br>

	I say it has happened, it happened, and it is happening, will happen, and will happen again and again.<br>
	I can’t figure it out, so I just say, it <a class="passage" href="08.html">happens</a>.
