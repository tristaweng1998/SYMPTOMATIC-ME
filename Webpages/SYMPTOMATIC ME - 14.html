On March 29, 2022, residents of a neighborhood in Shanghai's Minhang District gathered and shouted the slogan, 
"We want to eat, we want to go to work, we want to be free, we want the neighborhood committee to solve the problem.” <br>
That was as far as they dared to protest then.

Growing up in China, we are never too young to be told that the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is the “people's choice” and that we the people are the masters of our country.<br>
Grown up, many people — real <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 17.html">Chinese </a>people made up of humans — began to understand that it is a lie, as neither did we choose nor are we masterful of anything. <br><br>
However, in fact, it is not a lie. Because in the CCP's dictionary, the definition of “people” is precisely those who support the CCP. 
So the narrative is that the CCP is the <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 15.html">choice</a> of those who choose it. 
In philosophy, this is known as a circular argument, where the premises explicitly presume the conclusion to be proved. <br><br>

Hence, while the statement is logically correct, its demonstration of the “people's choice” is an accurate negation, or avoidance, of people. <br><br>
