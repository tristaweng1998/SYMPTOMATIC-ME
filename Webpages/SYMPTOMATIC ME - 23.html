    23. Unuttered

All these brings me to remember George Floyd, who was murdered after a brutal police officer pressed his knees to his neck for 9min and 29sec, 
and whose dying words, “I can't breathe”, so sincere and desperate, became a rallying cry for a new wave of BLM protests. <br><br>

In China, nevertheless, such tragedies or atrocities happen every day and everywhere under the Zero-Covid Policy. 
But they have never promoted the force of a united people, only died away in the sufferings of the victims. 
I take the reason being more than the fact that they are censored, but that the victims didn't utter some powerful words. <br><br>

Probably it is because of the language, as the Chinese synonym for “I can't breathe” is written as “我不能呼吸”, 
a line consisting of five characters with different pronunciations, which is difficult for a tortured person to utter at once. 
All he could say  is “救命”, which means “Help!”, a phrase too common to be used as a slogan of protest.<br><br>

But in many cases, even “Help!” was not uttered, and we just see the victim being in silence, as if he has already accepted his punishment. <br><br>

So did he deserve it? Did he deserve to be punished for his unuttered-ness while being punished in such an unfair way?<br><br>
