    24. Migrants and Immigrants
</h1>
</div>

<div class="flexbox" id="text">
<p class="text">

    One of the interesting things about <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 19.html">moving to the U.S.</a> is that sometimes you will find some specific concepts that appear confusing in your language 
    have clearer and more universal expressions in English. One example is “农民工”, which literally means “peasant workers” in Chinese, 
    but in the English phrase “migrant workers”, both its literal and connotative meaning are rendered satisfactorily. <br><br>

	Nonetheless, you need to have adequate experience living in China to understand the cultural and social weight it carries. 
    To introduce, Chinese culture/society is “from the soil” where people are connected to the soil more spiritually than materially. 
    The soil, the earth and the villages are our mothers and fathers who bear us and nurture us, and our sisters and brothers who accompany us. 
    Those who left the “soil” are always considered exiled, and many of them would spend their lifetime torn between “leaving the soil” and “returning to soil”. <br><br>

	Thus, migrant workers, the main force behind China's once economic miracle and who actually make up a significant portion of the country's population, 
    are wanderers who have lost their dependence on the land and have neither reliable shelter nor income. They are the epitome of insecurity and inequality in China, 
    whose voices are muffled in the black hole of information. Especially during the pandemic and under the Zero-Covid Policy. But in fact it is always the same.<br><br>

	Why am I talking about migrant workers here, of whom my knowledge is nothing beyond common sense? Probably because I consider myself a to-be immigrant now, 
    hence for the first time the anxiety about “leaving the soil” becomes something concrete and perceptible. <br><br>

        In locked-down villages, farmers are forbidden to farm during the day unless they obtain a “farming certificate” from the village committee. 
        So they farmed at midnight under the light of flashlight.
