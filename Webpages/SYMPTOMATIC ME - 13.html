    13. Beijing Normal University

<div class="flexbox" id="text">
<p class="text">
I did my undergraduate studies at Beijing Normal University, whose “normal” means it was an institution for training school <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 16.html">teachers</a> in the early 20th century. <br><br>

BNU is located in the center of Beijing, the closest of all universities to Tiananmen Square. 
It was the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement and the leading force behind the June Fourth Movement, 
two student protest movements 70 years apart but with the same power to shatter the corrupt governance. 
Liu Xiaobo was a teacher there. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 and died in prison. <br><br>

Ironically, while it was once a cradle of freedom and <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 17.html">rebellion</a>, it is now a place that beckons obedience. 
My teachers wrote the film history of the PRC (People's Republic of China). My department chair directed the PRC's 70th-anniversary celebration.<br><br>

Still, it was in the ashes and relics of my predecessors that I was enlightened with knowledge. 
There I learned and learned to learn. I took in what I believed to be genuine and authentic, and I rejected what I had doubted and repelled.

    On May 24, 2022, after a month of campus quarantine, BNU students gathered to protest the Covid regulations set by the university. 
    Miraculously they succeeded — they were allowed to leave the campus in an “orderly” manner.
