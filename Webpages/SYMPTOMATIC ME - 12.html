    12. Pinks

</div>

<div class="flexbox" id="text">
<p class="text">
Today, in China, there are many <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 14.html">people</a> whom we call, and also they call themselves, “Pinks”. 
In Chinese, it literally means “red fans” or “red fanatics” and it refers to those jingoistic nationalists who are 100 percent convinced by the government propaganda
 and believe they live in a greatest country envied by the world. <br><br>

My <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 15.html">biological</a> father and his relatives are all Pinks, most of whom are also ardent members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). 
He used to curse me for being brainwashed by the Western media and threatened to cut my living or educational funding if I sent him “fake news” about China.<br>
He did do that several times, so much so that I don't talk to him much now. <br><br>

But sometimes, I can't help but ask myself if I really have the right to tease those Pinks, as most of them don't have the privilege of seeing the outside world as I do
 — remember the first line of The Great Gatsby.<br>
Still, sometimes, I think even if they don't deserve to be damned, they do have some problems, or defects, in their personalities. 
It reminds me of many sad moments in my biological family that I do not want to talk about at this moment.
