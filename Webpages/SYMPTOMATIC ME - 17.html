            17. Bad Chinese

        I want to tell you that my Chinese is bad, or at least its test scores were the worst of all my subjects. <br><br>
        
        The story is that my Chinese wasn't always bad, actually, it was at the top level when I was in elementary school. 
        But at the beginning of middle school, I got into a big fight with my Chinese <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 16.html">teacher</a> because I disagreed with her stringent rules about punishing those who didn't do well in Chinese dictation. <br><br>
        
        The more detailed story is that I was the class monitor at the time, and I instituted a “class law” where a noticeable but not serious misbehavior should be deducted 2 points from one's “<a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 18.html">moral</a> evaluation”. 
        Whereas my Chinese teacher insisted that 10 points should be deducted for a failed dictation test, which, in my option, stood for a complete disregard for my regulation. 
        So after that resultless dispute, I refused to prepare myself well for the Chinese test anymore— I saw myself as a martyr — and my grades plummeted. <br><br>
        
        That accident, in some sense, changed the trajectory of my life. Because it was out of my rejection of Chinese that I fell in love with English, 
        and it was out of my love for English that I began to read and watch stories that were so far away from me then. <br><br>
        
        Nevertheless, today, as I still speak broken English and feel a tangible regression in my Chinese, 
        I wonder if I would have had a better or more balanced language education if I hadn't met that Chinese teacher. I don't know. Only I sense the sorrow of losing something important.

        In April 2022, a bakery chain called Paris Baguette was fined 580,000 yuan (about $90,000) for “illegally” serving bread to residents who were locked inside their homes during the Shanghai lockdown. 
        Some netizens wrote it a couplet that read, "We all suffer bitterness in life, but Paris Baguettes is sweet,” 
        where the Chinese pronunciation of “baguette” is itself similar to “super sweet”. A private joke and a sublime compliment.
