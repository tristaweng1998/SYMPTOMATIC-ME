In an episode of Bojack Horseman, one of my favorite animated series, Bojack delivered a soul-searching speech at the funeral of his abusive and alcoholic mother, 
referring to the last words she said when she looked at her son before being taken to the emergency room, “I see you.” 
Those words awakened all of Bojack's childhood memories of being neglected and mistreated, and all the unhappiness he could neither bear nor erase in his adult life. 
But the words seemed, for a moment, to assure him that he was finally getting the motherly attention he deserved. <br><br>

Nevertheless, at the end of his speech, Bojack suddenly realized that his mother was not actually saying “I see you”, 
but “ICU”. She was being sent to the intensive care unit, and she was just reading the sign.<br><br>

Somehow, the remembrance of this animated TV show brings me back to the very feeling I had when I was in China under the Zero-Covid Policy. <br>
There we are watched by the Supreme Leader and his lackeys, we are looked at by the world's media, 
and our stories are known to ourselves. Only in all that <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 08.html">happens</a>, we are not seen, that is, we are not attended to, not gazed at, and not understood.
