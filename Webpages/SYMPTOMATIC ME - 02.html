    I was <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 04.html">born</a> in China, where you don't need to (or maybe shouldn't) be self-conscious to grow up. <br>
    Everything is mapped out by the starting point you are given, and you follow the path.<br><br>

    Perhaps it was out of my <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 05.html">given</a> resistance or rebelliousness against this "givenness" that I pictured myself a future as a filmmaker at a young age, 
    believing it would open me up to a world I knew but could not feel around me. <br><br>
    
    However, it seems ironic that I did become a filmmaker when I started making documentaries, 
    where I turned my camera back to a place I had turned my back to a long time ago.
