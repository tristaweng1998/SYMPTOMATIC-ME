    15. Blood

Are biological relationships, bonds by blood, that important? Are we bound to love those whom we are bound by blood, or can we <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 14.html">choose</a> to love those we should not? <br><br>

This reminds me of my boss, my teacher, and my father of choice, Su Qing, an <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 19.html">independent</a> filmmaker, a musician, and a restaurateur whose family relationships, 
including his mother, three siblings, son, partner, and me, are all unrelated by blood. <br><br>

These kinds of relationships, something undefined between nullity and obligation, give him the greatest freedom to decide how and how much responsibility he should assume.
But as far as I can see, he has chosen to see them as an obligation, even though he doesn't love his family out of that obligation. <br><br>

In Chinese, there is a word that writes "萍水", Ping Shui, which describes strangers meeting by <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 20.html">coincidence</a> like patches of drifting duckweed. 
And in many stories, an encounter of Ping Shui is the beginning of a true friendship of destiny.

    Shi Jun, a doctor at a hospital in Heilongjiang province, committed suicide in April 2022 after admitting a patient for surgery who later tested positive for Covid. 
    He was accused of spreading the virus and was interrogated for seven days in all humiliation. <br>
     He left his elderly mother, wife and twin daughters who were still in middle school.
