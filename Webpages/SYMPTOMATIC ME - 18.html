    18. Moral Education

Chinese Philosophy is deeply ethical — something I learned when learning the term “ethics” as defined by Western Philosophy. <br><br>

It reminds me of Chloé Zhao, who spoke a line in Chinese in her historical award speech for Best Director at the 93rd Oscars ceremony, 
“人之初，性本善”, the first sentence of Three Character Classic that is imprinted in every Chinese child's mind, meaning “humans at birth are inherently good”.<br>
By the way, Chloé Zhao was blocked in China because after she won the Oscar, some netizens found out that she said in an interview years ago the very truth that “there are lies everywhere in China”.<br><br>

But as far as I can see, it was at the Oscars that she didn't tell the whole truth. 
For in traditional Chinese culture, there is a <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 19.html">counter-narrative</a> to the ideology of “inherent goodness”, 
which is “humans at birth are inherently evil”, as proposed by Xunzi, a contemporary of Confucius. And these two ideologies have had almost the same weight throughout Chinese history.<br><br>

But does it really matter? In my limited understanding of traditional Chinese culture, neither doctrine precludes the <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 20.html">possibility</a> that people can be good, 
regardless of their nature. Because humans can be, should be, and are to be educated. In fact, education is so vital that, in a sense, it plays the role of our religion. 
Thus we are always promised to become a better version of ourselves. <br><br>

And today, in the midst of the overwhelming despair caused by those political issues, I take the promise of goodness, empowered by the power of education, 
as my Elpis — the last hope — in the opened Pandora's box. <br><br>
