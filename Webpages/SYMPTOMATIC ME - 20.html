<h1>
    20. How to Get Covid?
</h1>

    The Zero-Covid Policy faced its greatest challenge when the Omicron variant came, and since the authorities didn't want their past deeds to be challenged, 
    it remained unchallengeable. Therefore, the local bureaucrats took this challenge by challenging the bottom line of ordinary <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 18.html">humanity</a>. <br><br>

	One of their commands, or comedies, is that children who test positive for Covid should be taken away and quarantined alone regardless of their age, 
    and they can be accompanied by their parents if and only if their parents also test positive. <br><br>

	Hence, many anxious and desperate mothers and fathers gathered in WeChat groups, where they asked, “how to get Covid as soon as possible?” <br><br>

	How absurd it is that while in most cases people chase coincidences in search of extra luck or fortune, 
    here those parents went out of their way to stumble upon coincidences just because they didn't want to miss a necessary mission. <br><br>

	My heart ached when I read these stories because even after all these years of <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 19.html">independence</a>, 
    I still remember my fear and trembling when I was sent to a boarding kindergarten as a little kid. Only I wonder if my mother had had the same anxiety or despair as they did.<br><br>
