    26. Bus

In the early morning of September 18, 2022, 27 people were killed and 20 others were seriously injured when a bus overturned on a hilly section of the highway from Guiyang to Libo in southwest China. 
An unprecedented outrage flooded on the Internet when people learned that it was a bus transporting “close contacts” of the test-positives to a quarantine facility.<br><br>

They wrote articles and comments pouring out their grief, anger, fear and despair, with the most shared headline being “we are on that bus, too”. <br><br>

Yes, that's exactly right, because at that moment everyone was at risk of being transported to those concentration camps where they would lose their dignity, 
livelihood, mental health and even their lives. <br><br>

But it also reminded me of the news which told us about those immigrant buses or ships where illegal immigrants were starved or suffocated to death 
while crossing the border between the United States and Mexico, or Europe and the Middle East. I rarely saw them, who was crying and yelling for the Guizhou Bus then, 
put any sympathy or pity on those deceased immigrants. Some of them even mocked them for deserving it and said they were glad to live in a country that was immune to all these tragedies.<br><br>

So, will they now change their minds and say, they were on those immigrant buses too? <br><br>
