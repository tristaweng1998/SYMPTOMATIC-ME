    5. The Myth of Given
</h1>
</div>

<div class="flexbox" id="text">
<p class="text">
In my Philosophy studies, one of the intriguing but no-ending debates I encountered is “The Myth of Given”, 
which (as I remember) illuminates the difficulty of elucidating the relationship between the nature of the mind and of the perception. 
Simply put, it asks, “Do I really see what I see?”, where the former “see” implies both the consequence of seeing as an action and the insight of seeing as a knowledge-induced understanding.<br><br>

But are our “givens” confined to the realm of our perceptions?<br>
I hold this question to myself as I gradually come to see that “The Myth of the Given” is more ethical than epistemological. 
It evokes the consciousness of, and at the same time casts doubts on, everything we are <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 04.html">born</a> with, such as race, gender, and social class, that constitutes our “first identity”.<br><br>
	
Then the question turns to something that demands our active responses, to the question, <br>
“Should I <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 07.html">see</a> myself as I am seen”?

        The White Guards, in a nod to the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), 
        have been a ubiquitous feature of China’s Zero-Covid Policy. Composed of police officers, 
        medical personnel and members of neighborhood committees, they serve as a major part of the state apparatus to ensure the people's obedience to the government. 
        Disguising their true identities with suits, they have earned themselves a reputation for physical violence and abuse of power.
