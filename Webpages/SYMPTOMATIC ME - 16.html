    16. One Child Family

 Both of my <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 15.html">biological</a> parents are university teachers. In China, this means that you work “within the system”, i.e., in a state-owned institution. 
 A job like this guarantees you a stable salary and reliable social benefits for life, unless you hit the "red line" that goes against the will of the Chinese Communist Party. <br><br>

The year I was born, 1998, was during the strictest period of the One-Child Policy. So, legally, if my parents had a second child, they would both lose their jobs. <br><br>

But I think that's quite a different story when I asked my parents why they didn't give me a sibling, they replied without hesitation that if they did, they would both lose their jobs. <br><br>

My question is, is it simply because they themselves didn't want a second child that they put the blame on the One-Child Policy, 
or did they pass up the opportunity to have a second child because they were afraid of the One-Child Policy? 
Or somewhere in between, did they not even think about having a second child because of the mere knowledge of the One-Child Policy? <br><br>

Either way, the past is in the past, and the reality is I am the only child whose growing up was steeped in inevitable loneliness, 
for I didn't have enough blood relations to rely on. Thus I learned to be <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 19.html">independent</a> at a very young age, and today I am still learning to be dependent.

        In January 2022, during the Xi'an lockdown, a woman with eight-month pregnancy was denied admission to the hospital when she was about to deliver 
        because she failed to present a negative Covid test. She miscarried her baby outside the hospital.
