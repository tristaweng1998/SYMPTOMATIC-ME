In China, I identify myself as a “Chinese independent filmmaker”, a term that refers to artists who make art “out of the system”, 
“体制” in Chinese, or state apparatus as paraphrased. This means not only that your income is not secured by state funding, 
but also that your status remains unacknowledged by mainstream society. In fact, at the beginning, we called ourselves “underground artists”, 
which means both literally that we were working in underground passages and metaphorically that our works were kept hidden underground as they are counter-narratives to the “main melody”. <br><br>

And, because of this undiminished “underground-ness," I had little <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 20.html">chance</a> to see those independent films until I came to Duke University, 
which, to my greatest astonishment, stocks hundreds of Chinese independent films in its online and offline libraries, in part because it is the very place where the China Memory Project is archived. <br><br>

So I searched and watched them in slips between my heavy coursework, yet it wasn't long before the images of the <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 24.html">land</a> where I was rooted began to appear both intimate and distant. 
For in the experience of viewing them here, I realized, with unspeakable sadness, that they were not only out of the system of China, 
but also out of the system of the world. That is, they challenged every standard of “professional filmmaking” as most of their makers were not <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 18.html">educated</a> in film school, 
and what they were talking about, in many cases, was either too “strange” to grasp or too horrible to accept. <br><br>

Yet it is in these fuzzy-and-fantasy images that our lives are held, gently and genuinely, and some invaluable stories are unearthed, which illuminates the existence of more forgotten stories.

        In Fuzhou, a random person filmed a scene in which local officials used a crane to drag residents who tested positive out of their homes. 
        Something too melodramatic to be filmed in real films.
