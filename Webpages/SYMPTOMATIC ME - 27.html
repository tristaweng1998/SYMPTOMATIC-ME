    27. Lost Childhood

When I look back on my past life in China, often I feel that my youth was shadowed, crippled and incomplete as it coincided with Xi's rise to power in 2012. <br><br>

But what about <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 20.html">children</a> today, who take Covid-tests as their only family game, and who either miss school in home quarantine or are at school being indoctrinated to learn those 
propaganda articles and songs that are nothing but garbage? <br><br>

Only I can tell myself that this era will not last long, so that those who have been led astray will eventually be oriented to the truth, 
and those who have undergone dehumanization will not lose their humanity, but take those experiences as valuable spiritual treasures 
which they can always learn from and reflect on. Just like I did.<br><br>

Still, would it be just better, or more securely better, if they have never had all these experiences?<br><br>
