    9. Feelings Lost
</h1>

Here and now I am in Durham, a place where I am completely free from the censorship imposed by the Chinese government and the censorship imposed on myself. 
I write, think, and do whatever I want without fear of violating the law, because I know my actions have been adjusted to stricter regulations.<br><br>

This longed-for freedom awakens the fullness of my potential, so my vision is graciously open to all my past experiences in my recollections, retrospections and reflections. 
And the distance, the earthly opposites, endows me the clarity of thoughts, as an old Chinese poem says, “不知庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中”, 
meaning that you won't know the mountain when you are dwelling in the mountain. <br><br>

However, with this maximum <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 13.html">knowledge</a> at hand, I also feel I have lost my true feelings about the “scene” because of my absence from the scene. 
Thus I disclaim myself as a <a href="SYMPTOMATIC ME - 12.html">convinced</a> teller, only to say, I am telling some stories.

    In November 2022, a working-class father in the Chinese city of Shenzhen broke down beside a blockade barricade in his area.
     He cried, "What should I do with my daughter's school fees? I have to go out and earn some money. I have to ...... I have to support my mother and my daughter. 
     I have to be there for them. I can't lose them." <br>
    That's as far as I can translate the content.
